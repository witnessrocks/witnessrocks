Xiao came to visit me in the hospital. Before leaving, he expressed hope that I could write down my testimony during this illness. I felt that these testimonies might hold some value for the church, which immediately gave me a sense of urgency—do I still have enough time granted by the Lord?

If I were to document all the testimonies after going to Nanjing, it would likely exceed my energy and time. So, I will begin by writing about the greatest blessings I have observed in my current situation, as the Lord has revealed them to me through the progression of my illness.

### Recognizing My Stubbornness and Overbearing Nature

The CT scan results completely shattered my dreams. In the face of facts, I had to admit that the naturopathic treatment I firmly believed in was nothing more than an illusion. The automatic shedding of the tumor, which I had been eagerly anticipating, was not going to happen. Not only that, but my condition had deteriorated to the point where surgery was no longer an option.

In light of this harsh reality, I had to reflect before the Lord: Why did I persist in believing that my condition was improving when everyone else thought it was worsening? Why did I insist it was improving, even as the tumor on my face grew larger—something basic knowledge would indicate as a worsening condition? Why did I see worsening bleeding and increasing physical weakness as signs of improvement? Why did I immediately accept the flimsiest of explanations from salespeople, to the point where it seemed I had lost all basic reasoning?

Thanks be to the Lord for His illumination, which allowed me to see that these distortions arose because I was entirely consumed by the set of beliefs I had stubbornly clung to. Under the influence of these beliefs, I interpreted pain as the tumor separating from healthy tissue; bleeding as the severing of blood vessels connecting to the tumor; and tumor growth as its final struggle. Consequently, I came to recognize my subjectivity, stubbornness, and the foolishness that arose from this stubbornness—even to the extent of ignoring the most evident facts and distorting them into something that fit my narrative.

The Lord swiftly made me aware of how my insistence on my own views had played out in other areas, such as in church deacon meetings, where I held my ground to the point of clashing with every other deacon. Previously, when most of the deacons said I was too stubborn, I brushed it off and even considered myself accommodating. But through this illness, the Lord made me realize that my so-called "accommodation" only applied to matters I was not particularly concerned about or where I had no authority to make decisions.

The Lord also revealed a strong underlying desire in my subconscious—a need to dominate and have the final say. "So, you like to lead?" He seemed to ask. "Here is the result of your leadership: cancer that has spread to an untreatable stage. This is the outcome of the choices you thought were right."

Moreover, the Lord helped me see how my hidden desire for dominance, combined with my subjectivity and stubbornness, had likely caused untold difficulties for the church and harm to my brothers and sisters. Sometimes I overheard them say I had a bad temper, or fellow deacons mentioned my forceful manner of speaking, and I simply attributed it to having a poor temper. I even prayed for the Lord to deliver me from it.

I thank the Lord for using this severe illness to thoroughly examine my service over the past few years.

Indeed, the Lord has used me greatly over the years—this I have personally experienced, especially in preaching, where I deeply felt the Lord's supply. The Lord's use of me was never the issue; the problem was that the more He used me, the more pride crept into my heart, and the more I saw myself as exceptional. Unconsciously, I accumulated a growing sense of superiority. In other words, the more the Lord used me, the greater the sin within me became. Consequently, I have come to realize that any benefit my past ministry might have brought to the church was entirely the work of the Holy Spirit, who can even work through Balaam’s donkey. As for myself, I see only wood, hay, and stubble in my heart. The Lord also made me aware of how I approached sermons given by others: unless they were by Pastor Wang, I wasn't listening to learn but to critique. After repenting, I began to join Hai Mei in listening to live sermons by other coworkers. To my surprise, I not only calmed down to listen seriously but also gained much from them.

### Returning My Heart to the Lord

Because of my previous experience in business, I paid great attention to the efficient use of funds. Any temporarily unused money in my household would go into the stock market, as I felt that bank interest rates were too low, and bank deposits would only depreciate. After becoming a believer, I continued this practice. From a rational standpoint, investing in stocks for profit seemed no different from depositing money in a bank for interest—both were legal and not inherently sinful. It was this reasoning that kept me engaged in the stock market.

In fact, since becoming a believer, I never lost money in the stock market, achieving annual returns of 8–15%, as I no longer acted greedily. During prayers of confession, the thought of stocks sometimes crossed my mind, but I always dismissed it because I was convinced it wasn’t sinful.

However, after moving to Nanjing and as my illness progressed, my physical condition worsened. One night, I had what seemed like a dream—or perhaps it wasn’t a dream—where I felt a message of curse: that I would get worse and worse. I woke up abruptly in a fit of violent coughing. From that night on, I coughed every night, severely affecting my sleep. Unable to bear it anymore, I eventually went to the hospital for antibiotics.

That same night, while in a half-awake state, I thought to myself: The antibiotics should help, right? But then an inner voice immediately said: No way. I woke up completely and realized that the previous curse-like message and this thought couldn’t have come from God. They were likely from an evil spirit. As a child of God, why would I accept messages from an evil spirit? Did I have a breach—some sin I was aware of but unwilling to repent from? My mind immediately turned to stocks.

It was then that I realized that every time the thought of stocks arose during prayer, it had been the Holy Spirit reminding me. Deep down, I had doubted whether my involvement in stocks was sinful, but I always justified it with knowledge, reasoning that investing in stocks wasn’t inherently sinful and wasn’t for the purpose of getting rich.

Objectively, trading stocks isn’t sinful, but why had it become sin for me? It wasn’t until the Lord brought me to a life-threatening situation that I became fully aware: I couldn’t let go of the stock market because I still valued money and harbored greed. Reflecting on how I frequently checked the market every day—even if only for a minute—I realized that part of my heart had been drawn away, no longer fully devoted to the Lord. The Lord says, “My son, give me your heart” (Proverbs 23:26), yet my heart had been given to the stock market. Isn’t that terrifying? After realizing this, the very next day, I sold all my stocks—over one million yuan, which had just been freed up from selling a house. Regardless of profit or loss, I sold them all (except for some shares I couldn’t immediately sell due to regulatory restrictions, which I sold later). I then made a vow before the Lord never to touch stocks again.

### Gaining Insight into the Value of Suffering

Before this illness, I always believed that suffering was something negative. Whether physical or mental, no one would willingly embrace suffering. I often prayed that God would give me strength to endure suffering, but I never once prayed for God to give me suffering. Instead, I prayed that He would remove it. But this time, through severe illness, the Lord revealed to me the value and meaning of suffering, which deeply changed my perspective.

Suffering Leads to Greater Understanding of God's Word.
I used to read the Bible with intellectual understanding. Even though I would pray for insight before reading, I never felt a deep resonance. The meaning of some verses seemed mysterious or abstract. However, after experiencing suffering, I came to realize how personal and real God’s Word truly is. For example, Psalm 23 says, “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.” I used to take these words as poetic imagery. But now, experiencing the shadow of death myself, I truly feel God’s presence and comfort. It’s not just abstract knowledge but a vivid, life-giving truth that sustains me through my trials.

Similarly, Hebrews 12:6 says, “The Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.” This verse used to confuse me because I equated God’s love with blessings, not discipline. But now I see that God's chastening is not only an expression of His love but also a way to refine and transform us. Through suffering, I’ve come to understand that God's purpose is to shape me more into His likeness.

Suffering Brings True Dependence on God.
Before my illness, I thought I depended on God. I prayed often, served in church, and sought His guidance in big decisions. But through this illness, I’ve come to realize how much I relied on my own strength and understanding. I thought my knowledge, reasoning, and experiences could guide me, but they failed me when faced with cancer. When my efforts and plans failed, I had no choice but to fully rely on God. In my weakness, I experienced His strength. In my confusion, I experienced His wisdom. The more I surrendered, the more I felt His peace and power.

Suffering Produces Eternal Fruit.
In the past, I focused on short-term gains—whether in ministry, family, or personal goals. My prayers often reflected this mindset: I would ask God for things that would benefit me or the church in the here and now. But through this trial, God has shifted my focus from temporary gains to eternal rewards. Suffering has taught me to value what is truly important: growing in Christlikeness, deepening my faith, and leading others to the eternal hope of salvation.

One day, as I reflected on my suffering, I felt the Lord asking: “If this suffering produces lasting fruit for eternity, is it worth it to you?” I struggled to answer at first. I didn’t want to embrace suffering, but I knew the answer had to be yes. I realized that through suffering, God was drawing me closer to Himself and using my experience to encourage others. This eternal perspective gave me peace and even joy in the midst of my pain.

### Experiencing the Lord's Abundant Grace

Amid this illness, I’ve experienced the Lord’s grace in ways I never imagined. His provision, comfort, and blessings have been evident at every turn, especially when I felt most helpless.

Financial Provision.
Before my diagnosis, I never thought about how much money I would need for medical expenses. I had always trusted in my savings and investments to cover any costs. But after being diagnosed with cancer, the expenses quickly added up. To my surprise, the Lord provided in miraculous ways. Friends, family, and even church members I didn’t know well contributed financially to help cover my treatment. Their generosity reminded me that God is Jehovah Jireh—He provides for all our needs.

Spiritual Comfort.
When I first learned of my diagnosis, I was overwhelmed with fear and despair. I asked the Lord repeatedly, “Why me?” But as I prayed and read His Word, I felt a deep sense of peace. Verses like “Do not fear, for I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10) and “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9) spoke directly to my heart. I realized that even in my darkest moments, God was with me, carrying me through.

Support from the Church.
One of the greatest blessings during this time has been the love and support of my brothers and sisters in Christ. Many have visited me, prayed for me, and encouraged me with Scripture. Their care has reminded me of the unity of the body of Christ and the importance of bearing one another’s burdens. Through their love, I have seen a glimpse of God's love for me.

Healing in Relationships.
This illness has also brought healing to broken relationships. In the past, I had disagreements with certain family members and church coworkers. But facing a life-threatening illness has softened my heart and theirs. I reached out to reconcile with those I had hurt or wronged, and they responded with grace and forgiveness. These restored relationships are a testament to God's power to bring beauty from ashes.

### Looking Forward with Hope

Though my physical condition remains uncertain, my hope in the Lord is stronger than ever. I do not know how much time I have left, but I know that every day is a gift from Him. I want to use whatever time I have to glorify Him, encourage others, and share the gospel.

This illness has taught me that life is fleeting and fragile, but eternity with God is secure and unshakable. As the apostle Paul said, “For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain” (Philippians 1:21). If the Lord extends my life, I will continue serving Him with joy. And if He calls me home, I will rejoice in His presence forever.

In closing, I want to leave this testimony as a reminder of God's faithfulness and grace. No matter what trials we face, He is with us, working all things for our good and His glory. May His name be praised forever.
