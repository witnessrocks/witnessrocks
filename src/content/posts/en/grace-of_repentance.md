description: For about eight or nine years, she endured this suffering, waiting for me to repent. But it never came. The last time, I beat her so badly she couldn’t get up from the ground. I asked, “Do you yield?” She didn’t. So I kept hitting her.

### Preface

Thank the Lord for giving me the grace to testify for Him once again. I feel very ashamed, as my past experiences are rather unique. Each time I give a testimony, I feel so weak, lacking the strength to share.

I accepted Jesus on December 8, 2013. In just about a month, I will have been a believer for six years. During this period, I have experienced countless graces from God. Among them, for me, the greatest grace is repentance.

Being able to repent is the greatest grace in my journey of believing in Jesus. This is because, relying on my own strength, I could never have repented. In the past, I lived entirely in my own world. That I could repent is truly miraculous!

I have experienced countless failures, completely unable to repent on my own strength. Just a few days ago, while sharing the gospel and testifying to a colleague, he angrily interrupted, saying, “Nonsense!” If this had happened before, I would have thought, Why am I even doing this? Ruining my image and inviting insults—what’s wrong with me?

But that day, when he said that, I replied, “You’re right. I am nonsense.” I added, “My wife says the same thing about me. She doesn’t just call me nonsense; she says I’m a liar, a scoundrel—she’s said it all. And she’s not wrong, because that’s who I was.”

A few days later, while I was busy cleaning the work compound early in the morning, a coworker saw me working nonstop while others were chatting. He asked, “Wang Feng, were you really like that in the past?” He had probably heard my story from other colleagues. When he found out, he was shocked. “I can’t believe it. Were you really that kind of person?”

I answered, “I was exactly like that. What you’ve heard is only the tip of the iceberg. If I told you everything I used to do, your reaction would be even stronger.” Now, I want to share a part of that iceberg—the repentance and redemption God has brought to my family, and the grace that saved us.

### A Shattered Family

I was born into an ordinary family, but it was pitifully broken. From the time I started kindergarten until second grade, I wore open-crotch pants. At school, I felt deeply ashamed and inferior. In first grade, my father was arrested for brawling. It was during the nationwide crackdown on crime, and he was sentenced to three years in a re-education labor camp.

During those years, classmates often taunted and insulted me, making my life feel unbearably unfair. I would question why I was born into this family—poor and burdened with a father like mine. Why were other families so much better? I kept asking, Why me?

When my father returned, I had hoped he would change, realizing the pain he caused our family and especially my mother. My mother had struggled to raise me and my sister through extreme hardship, sometimes borrowing even the tiny sum needed for school fees. I often returned home to an empty house, sleeping outside the front gate. I thought my father would come back filled with remorse. But to my surprise, he returned with even worse habits.

At first, things seemed better, but soon he became even more abusive. My parents frequently fought, often resorting to knives or scissors. My mother attempted suicide three times—once by drinking pesticide. I was about ten years old then and vividly remember seeing her foam at the mouth before rushing her to the hospital to save her life.

Another time, she jumped into a river. On yet another occasion, during a fight, my mother stabbed my father in the back with a knife, missing his kidney by only two centimeters. I was around 14 or 15 then and in middle school. At the hospital, the doctor asked me, “Who did this? You need to call the police.” I told the doctor it was my mother, and he walked away without saying another word.

Their fights grew worse, and my mother often called on me for help. As a boy, I’d wield whatever I could—a rolling pin when I was small, a stool when I grew bigger, and eventually, as a strong teenager, I didn’t need any tools—I fought him with my bare hands. Many times, I beat him so badly that he called the police to have me arrested.

The relationship between my father and me was devoid of any affection. I stopped calling him “Dad” for years. To me, he was just a stranger I despised.

As a child, I vowed never to become like him—smoking, drinking, and abusing my wife. But fate played a cruel trick, and I ended up repeating his mistakes. I started drinking and smoking under the influence of friends. Once drunk, I couldn’t control my behavior, no matter how much I wanted to.

### My Own Family Repeated My Past

When I started dating my wife, we were together for two years, but I never once invited her to my home. It was only close to our wedding that I took her there. She was furious, calling me a liar for hiding the state of my family. Though disappointed, she resigned herself, saying, “Let’s just try to live well after marriage.”

But our marriage was far from peaceful or happy. I surrounded myself with drinking buddies, went to nightclubs, and lied to my wife. Even after we had children, I continued to cheat on her.

The first time I hit her, she was pregnant with our first daughter. She had caught me chatting online with a Korean woman and sabotaged my messages out of anger. Furious, I hit her—and I hit her hard.

After that, I couldn’t stop. Every argument turned physical. Yet every time, I would regret it afterward. I knew it was wrong to hit a woman, but I couldn’t control myself in the heat of the moment.

For eight or nine years, my wife endured this torment, hoping I would change. But I didn’t. The last time I beat her, she was so bruised she couldn’t stand. Still, I asked, “Do you yield?” When she didn’t, I hit her again.

Eventually, she couldn’t take it anymore. After one particularly brutal fight, she returned to her parents’ house, leaving me. When her father called, I had the audacity to blame her, refusing to acknowledge my fault.

### Grace Intervened

Just when my family was about to collapse, the Lord chose me.

Once I accepted Jesus, I made a firm decision: if I was going to believe, I would take it seriously. No half-hearted faith.

When I asked fellow believers how to live like a follower of Jesus, they told me, “You must start at home.” So, I began to change—washing clothes, cooking, cleaning, and watching the children, things I used to avoid. At the same time, I gave up smoking, drinking, and lying. These transformations weren’t from me but from God’s grace.

When I told my wife about my newfound faith, she dismissed it. She had no interest in reconciliation. Still, I said, “If you give me three years, I’ll show you I’m truly a changed man.” She scoffed but allowed me to stay.

### Jesus is Christ

Over time, she saw my gradual transformation—how I stopped drinking, smoking, and lying, and how I treated her with newfound respect and love. Eventually, she believed in my repentance.

One day, as I shared my faith, she broke down, crying, and said, “Why couldn’t you have been this person before?” Her heart softened, and she began attending church.

Today, not only has our marriage been restored, but my father also came to faith and was baptized in July. God’s grace has transformed our broken family into a family of faith.

All glory be to our Lord Jesus!
